## 📖 Overview

R3-RAG is a novel framework that uses **R**einforcement learning to teach LLMs how to **R**eason and **R**etrieve step by step. Unlike traditional RAG methods that rely on human-designed workflows, R3-RAG enables models to autonomously learn optimal reasoning-retrieval strategies through reinforcement learning with both outcome and process rewards.

### Key Features
- 🔥 **Autonomous Learning**: Uses RL to learn reasoning-retrieval strategies instead of relying on fixed human-designed workflows
- 🎯 **Dual Reward System**: Combines outcome rewards (answer correctness) with process rewards (document relevance)
- 🚀 **Strong Performance**: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art iterative RAG methods
- 🔄 **Transferable**: Works across different retrievers (E5, BGE, BM25) with consistent performance
- 📊 **Comprehensive**: Evaluated on multiple multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue)

## 📊 Main Results

Our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across three multi-hop QA datasets:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Setup

We recommend setting up three separate conda environments to avoid dependency conflicts:

1. **FlashRAG Environment** (for retrieval tools): Please refer to [FlashRAG](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG) to set up the environment.

2. **LLaMA-Factory Environment** (for cold start training): Please refer to [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) to set up the environment.

3. **OpenRLHF Environment** (for RL training): Please refer to [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF) to set up the environment, then install our modified openrlhf code in this repository.

### Model Download
